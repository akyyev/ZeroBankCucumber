Maven default life cycles
    ❏ validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
    ❏ compile - compile the source code of the project
    ❏ test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework
    ❏ verify - run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria

Maven Commands:
    clean - remove all files generated by the previous build
    install - copy .jar file to local maven repository
    deploy - send it to remote repository
    
    mvn verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @smoke"
    mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @smoke"

-Dcucumber.options="--tags @someTag" - provide scenarios that you want to run. No need to change CucumberRunner class.

Overriding Cucumber Options
At times, you would need to override the configurations specified in @CucumberOptions. 
If we want to override the configurations mentioned in the Runner, 
then we need to use following command: 

    mvn test –DCucumber.options=”Your Options”


To run regression test: 

    mvn test -P Regression
-P Regression => profile and name of the profile from pom.xml file.
